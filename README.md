# project-two

**Background**

For this group project, we wanted to explore the changes in single family home prices across the country in the past 30 years. We used data from the Federal Housing Finance Agency Housing Price Index to look at the changes in single-family home values from all 50 states plus Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia since the 1990s. 

**Tools Used**

1. Python
2. Pandas
3. Jupyter Notebook
4. D3 Library
5. HTML
6. CSS
7. JavaScript
8. Leaflet
9. Plotly
10. SQLite
11. Flask

**Project Tasks**

We started by pulling the large dataset into a Jupyter Notebook to explore the data and divide it into three different data frames: USA data, Puerto Rico data, and State data. From there, we imported the data into a SQLite database. Next, we created a Flask app to read the database and created different API endpoints based on the data. From there, we were each tasked with creating separate charts to display on our webpage.
